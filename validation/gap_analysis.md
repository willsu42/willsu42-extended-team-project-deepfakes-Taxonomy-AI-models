# Gap Analysis & Opportunity Framing

## Speed Dating Interviews (Internal Discussions)

### Interview 1 - Sammy: Reliability & Safety (w/ Sage)
* **Focus:** Can current tools support clinical cybersecurity research?
* **Feedback:** "Every time I try to document how an NCEI bot works, the AI shuts down the conversation. It treats researchers like bad actors."
* **Identified Gap:** **Safety Over-Correction.** General AI tools are too sanitized for threat intelligence work.

### Interview 2 - Sammy: UX Friction & Latency (w/ Will)
* **Focus:** The workflow of manual data entry.
* **Feedback:** "Converting a 1,000-word news article into a structured SQL entry manually takes forever. I have to verify the model, the date, and the platform myself."
* **Identified Gap:** **High Latency/Friction.** There is no automated pipeline that turns "News" into "Structured Intelligence."

### Interview 3 - Will: Accuracy & Reliability (w/ Sammy)
* **Focus:** The "Black Hole" effect of existing reporting tools.
* **Feedback:** "When I report an NCEI incident to a platform, I get a 'thank you' message and the image eventually vanishes, but I never learn how it was made. I'm left in the dark about whether it was a specific model exploit or a prompt injection bypass that might happen again tomorrow."
* **Identified Gap:** **Information Asymmetry.** Current tools are reactive and one-way; they remove content but fail to return structured technical intelligence to the researcher or victim.

### Interview 4 - Will: Latency & UX Friction (w/ Sage)
* **Focus:** The transition from "Incident Logging" to "Actionable Defense."
* **Feedback:** "I expect a 'result' to be a technical signature I can use to update my filters, but all I get is a confirmation of deletion. There is a massive delay between seeing an attack and actually having the data needed to block the method of that attack across the whole platform."
* **Identified Gap:** **Actionability Gap.** Existing platforms focus on content-takedown (reactive) rather than threat-modeling (proactive).

### Interview 5 - Luke: Accuracy & Reliability (w/ Sammy)
* **Focus:** The impact of environmental noise (compression/blur) on verification.
* **Feedback:** "When I try to verify a reported NCEI incident from a social media grab, standard detectors often flip-flop their scores. The compression 'washes away' the microscopic artifacts the model is looking for, making the result feel like a coin toss."
* **Identified Gap:** **Environmental Sensitivity.** Current high-fidelity detection tools are optimized for raw lab data but fail significantly in the 'dirty' data environments of real-world social media where NCEI often spreads.

### Interview 6 - Luke: UX Friction & Actionability (w/ Sage)
* **Focus:** Moving from "Detection Score" to "Structured Metadata."
* **Feedback:** "Even if a tool tells me there is a 98% chance an image is a deepfake, it doesn't tell me *why* or *how*. To fill out our Sentinel taxonomy, I still have to manually hunt for whether it was a specific model bypass or a generative exploit."
* **Identified Gap:** **Contextual Blindness.** Existing forensic tools provide a binary output but fail to generate the structured, taxonomy-aligned technical intelligence required for proactive defense.

### Interview 7 - Sage: Research Visibility & Knowledge Sharing (w/ Luke)
* **Focus:** Communicating technical findings across teams.
* **Feedback:** "Even when we document incidents carefully in our database, the insights are hard to share with others. Researchers, journalists, and policymakers often cannot easily see patterns across incidents."
* **Identified Gap:** **Insight Accessibility Gap.** Existing tools store incident data but fail to surface patterns and insights in ways that support broader awareness and decision-making.

### Interview 8 - Sage: Research Workflow & Data Structuring (w/ Will)
* **Focus:** Translating qualitative incidents into structured datasets
* **Feedback:** "Most incidents are reported as long narrative news articles or scattered social media posts. To use them in our taxonomy, I have to manually read everything and extract fields like platform, threat vector, and model. It’s extremely time-consuming."
* **Identified Gap:** **Unstructured-to-Structured Bottleneck.** There is no tool that automatically converts narrative incident reports into structured, taxonomy-ready intelligence.

## Opportunity Framing
Sentinel fills the gaps left by general-purpose AIs by meeting these specific requirements:

1.  **Research-Grade Access:** Unlike Copilot/ChatGPT, Sentinel provides a clinical environment for documenting threat vectors without triggering moralizing safety blocks.
2.  **Schema-First Design:** While others provide prose, Sentinel uses Llama 3 to output **Structured Metadata** (JSON) designed for database ingestion.
3.  **Technical Taxonomy:** Sentinel focuses on the *how* (LoRA, Fine-tuning, API) rather than just the *what* (The news story).
